# HelloWorldExternalLibs
A Basic example of using pre built external shared libs (.so) and static libs (.a) libraries in Android


Build .so in Android Studio by simply Building APK on your JNI project. Once APK is build, you will find the so lib under 
<i>/app/build/intermediates/cmake/debug/obj/</i> 

Similary build an .a static library(read some blogs)

Import them as shown in the commits diff and you are good to go
